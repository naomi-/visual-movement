# visual-movement
Arduino project where you can make drawings from movement.

Ballet slippers use Arduino microcontrollers, pressure sensors, 9DOF sensors, and Bluetooth modules to track movement and communicate with Processing. Processing is used to visualize the movement onscreen. Iâ€™m currently improving the visualization aspect of this project.
